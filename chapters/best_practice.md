# üöÄ Best Practice
*just some unofficial notes*

Every design decision affects the total number of nodes and the complexity of the runtime model. Striking a balance between reusability, modularity, and performance is key, always considering the target hardware where the project will be deployed.

## Handling Node Count
- [ ] PLC variables are counted as nodes at the start of the Runtime, always import only variables that you need to exchange with the HMI.
- [ ] Each dynamic link = at least 3 OPC UA nodes
    - [ ] The materialized property node (no longer inherited from its base type).
    - [ ] The link node represents the connection.
    - [ ] The target node receiving the linked value
- [ ] Minimize converters (especially when nested) and nested dynamic links
- [ ] Avoid complex links in reused/high-traffic objects
- [ ] Prefer aliases over dynamic links in same container

Each dynamic link adds at least 2-3 extra references, and complex dynamic links (e.g., converters, expressions, switch-case logic) may add dozens. More references = slower traversal and resolution time.
(see [Diagnostic Tools](#7-diagnostic-tools))

## Image & Graphic Optimization
- [ ] PNGs are lighter to render, SVGs offer greater flexibility (but "Advanced SVG Image" object can have a lot of dynamic links ...)
- [ ] Optimize/compress PNGs
- [ ] Avoid large/uncompressed images
- [ ] Balance performance and quality
- [ ] Use stylesheets and single dynamic links for styles

## Reducing Overhead
- [ ] Replace complex dynamic links with NetLogics to centralize data processing
- [ ] Aggregate shared variables across multiple objects to reduce redundancy.

## Dynamic Object Management
- [ ] Avoid preloading unnecessary UI objects
- [ ] Use NetLogic for dynamic instantiation/lazy loading
- [ ] Instantiate objects only when needed: avoid using "Visible" property

    ### Why?
    
    FT Optix renders and loads a page only when all its components are fully initialized. This means that if a page contains many preloaded objects, the system will take longer to process everything before displaying the UI. This can result in longer load times and a noticeable delay when switching between pages.
    
    By using dynamic instantiation with NetLogic scripts, you can create and manage objects only when they are needed, instead of preloading everything at once. This approach is especially useful when dealing with repetitive elements, such as multiple instances of the same type of object that are only shown based on user interaction or external triggers.
    
    One of the biggest benefits of this method is that it enables a form of lazy loading, where objects are instantiated while the page is already displayed and functional. 
    This results in:
    - [ ] Faster initial page loads, as only the essential UI elements are rendered upfront.
    - [ ] Smoother page transitions, since additional objects are loaded dynamically without delaying the page display.
    - [ ] Better resource management, as objects can be destroyed and recreated on demand, reducing memory usage.
    
    This method is particularly advantageous in scenarios where many UI elements would otherwise be hidden by default, such as complex dashboards, interactive lists, or modal pop-ups. Instead of keeping them in memory while hidden, you can instantiate them only when required, ensuring optimal performance.

## Project Structure
- [ ] Store all graphics in the UI folder, organized by Templates/Screens
- [ ] Use a single EmbeddedDatabase with multiple tables if needed
- [ ] Place global variables in the Model folder
- [ ] Use Panels to group items for permissions/logic

## Naming Rules
- [ ] Use meaningful names for all project elements (avoid defaults, numbers, abbreviations)
- [ ] Use PascalCase for object names, camelCase for variables
- [ ] Use English for object names and localization keys
- [ ] Avoid using Panel+Rectangle for backgrounds; use Screen, Rectangle, or Panel as appropriate

## Diagnostic Tools
- [ ] Project information

 When you open the project in IDE the Studio Output will provide you with the actual number of nodes of the project. The message will contain the path of the project following the nodes count. In the same way, if you open with a text editor the project file with extension ‚Äú.optix‚Äù you will find at the end of the file, the statistics of the project

- [ ] Use NodesCounterDialog widget
    - [ ] Identify high node count pages
    - [ ] Detect bottlenecks
    - [ ] Analyze elements for optimization
