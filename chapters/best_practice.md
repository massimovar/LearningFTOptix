# üöÄ Best Practice
*just some unofficial notes*

Every design decision affects the total number of nodes and the complexity of the runtime model. Striking a balance between reusability, modularity, and performance is key, always considering the target hardware where the project will be deployed.

## 1. UI Design Principles
Ensure UI is efficient and responsive
- [ ] Minimize node count per page (see [Diagnostic Tools](#7-diagnostic-tools))
- [ ] Avoid unnecessary graphics, variables, and dynamic links
- [ ] Use stylesheets and single dynamic links for styles

## 2. Handling Node Count
- [ ] PLC variables are counted as nodes at the start of the Runtime, always import only variables that you need to exchange with the HMI.
- [ ] Each dynamic link = at least 3 OPC UA nodes
    - [ ] The materialized property node (no longer inherited from its base type).
    - [ ] The link node represents the connection.
    - [ ] The target node receiving the linked value
- [ ] Minimize converters (especially when nested) and nested dynamic links
- [ ] Avoid complex links in reused/high-traffic objects
- [ ] Prefer aliases over dynamic links in same container
Each dynamic link adds at least 2-3 extra references, and complex dynamic links (e.g., converters, expressions, switch-case logic) may add dozens. More references = slower traversal and resolution time.

## 3. Image & Graphic Optimization
- [ ] PNGs are lighter to render, SVGs offer greater flexibility
- [ ] Optimize/compress PNGs
- [ ] Avoid large/uncompressed images
- [ ] Balance performance and quality

## 4. Reducing Overhead
- [ ] Use scripts (NetLogic) for complex logics
- [ ] Aggregate shared variables

## 5. Dynamic Object Management
- [ ] Avoid preloading unnecessary UI objects
- [ ] Use NetLogic for dynamic instantiation/lazy loading
- [ ] Instantiate objects only when needed: avoid using "Visible" property
- [ ] [Reference: Creating Objects](https://github.com/FactoryTalk-Optix/NetLogic_CheatSheet/blob/main/pages/creating-objects.md#iuaobjects)

## 6. Project Structure & Naming Rules
- [ ] Use meaningful names for all project elements (avoid defaults, numbers, abbreviations)
- [ ] Use PascalCase for object names, camelCase for variables
- [ ] Store all graphics in the UI folder, organized by Templates/Screens
- [ ] Use a single EmbeddedDatabase with multiple tables if needed
- [ ] Place global variables in the Model folder
- [ ] Use HTML color names (e.g., `red`), avoid hex unless needed
- [ ] Use English for object names and localization keys
- [ ] Sort items by type in the project tree
- [ ] Use Panels to group items for permissions/logic
- [ ] Match Label names and LocalizationDictionary keys
- [ ] Use keywords in control names to clarify purpose (e.g., `VoltageText`, `VoltageValue`)
- [ ] Avoid using Panel+Rectangle for backgrounds; use Screen, Rectangle, or Panel as appropriate

## 7. Diagnostic Tools
- [ ] Project information
      When you open the project in IDE the Studio Output will provide you with the actual number of nodes of the project. The message will contain the path of the project following the nodes count. In the same way, if you open with a text editor the project file with extension ‚Äú.optix‚Äù you will find at the end of the file, the statistics of the project
- [ ] Use NodesCounterDialog widget
    - [ ] Identify high node count pages
    - [ ] Detect bottlenecks
    - [ ] Analyze elements for optimization
